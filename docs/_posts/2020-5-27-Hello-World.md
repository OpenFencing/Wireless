The Sport of Fencing is one of not many to require electricity to play. It's a simple concept: There is electricity running through the weapons and the Fencer's are either wearing on standing on a conductive material than can verify whether a hit has been scored. 

The Sabre is the simplest in this regard, if you make a circuit, the light goes off - it's that simple (there are some timing requirements but that's not important right now). I touch you, current flows through your Lame (a conductive jacket), through the wire, and into the scoring system.
